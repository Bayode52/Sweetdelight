## What Are Small Chops?

Small chops is the beloved Nigerian term for a selection of small savoury finger foods, served as starters or party nibbles. The phrase "small chops" refers to the portion size — bite-sized, easy to eat while socialising, and always incredibly delicious.

In Nigeria, no party, naming ceremony, wedding, or celebration is complete without a tray (or several!) of small chops being passed around. They are the social glue of every gathering.

## What's Typically Included?

A small chops platter usually includes a selection of the following:

- **Puff Puff** – Soft, slightly sweet deep-fried dough balls. The most iconic item on any platter
- **Samosas** – Crispy triangular pastries filled with spiced meat or vegetables
- **Mini Spring Rolls** – Golden fried rolls with vegetables and minced meat filling
- **Chicken on Sticks** – Marinated, grilled or fried chicken skewers with peppered sauce
- **Fish Rolls** – Crispy shortcrust pastry filled with spiced tuna or salmon
- **Peppered Gizzard** – Tender chicken gizzard cooked in a bold pepper sauce
- **Mini Sausage Rolls** – Buttery puff pastry wrapped around seasoned pork sausage

The exact combination varies by caterer and occasion, but puff puff is almost always present.

## The History of Small Chops in Nigerian Culture

Small chops became popular in Nigeria's urban centres — Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt — during the 1980s and 1990s as a party food staple. The concept was influenced by British party finger foods, but transformed with Nigerian flavours and ingredients.

Over time, small chops became a symbol of celebration and abundance. To serve generous small chops at your party is a sign of hospitality and status.

## Small Chops in the UK

As the Nigerian diaspora grew in the UK, so did the demand for authentic small chops. Nigerian community events, naming ceremonies, birthday parties, and church gatherings all feature small chops as a centrepiece.

Today, Sweet Delight brings these authentic flavours to homes across the UK. Made fresh to order, using traditional recipes — our small chops platters are the same quality you'd find at the best parties in Lagos.

## Ordering Small Chops for Your Event

Planning an event? Here's what to consider:

- **Quantity**: For a party, allow 5–8 pieces per person as a starter
- **Lead time**: Order at least 48 hours in advance for standard platters; 5 days for very large orders
- **Customisation**: We can adjust the selection based on dietary requirements (vegetarian options available)

## Planning a Nigerian Party in the UK

Whether it's a naming ceremony (Omugwo), a birthday, a graduation, or a traditional wedding, Nigerian parties in the UK are vibrant, joyful celebrations centred around community, fashion, and above all — food.

## Venue Considerations

When selecting a venue in the UK, consider:

- **Capacity**: Nigerian parties often grow beyond the original guest list. Add 20–30% to your expected headcount
- **Kitchen access**: If you're self-catering, confirm kitchen access for warming food
- **Halal options**: Ensure any venue catering is aware of halal requirements
- **Décor**: Many UK venues now accommodate Nigerian party aesthetics (Ankara table runners, traditional centrepieces)

## The Food: Getting the Quantities Right

**Small Chops** (per person as starter):
- 5–8 pieces per person for 2-hour party
- 10–12 pieces for all-day events

**Celebration Cake**:
- A 10" round cake typically serves 30–40 guests (finger portions)
- For a large party of 100+, consider a tiered cake or multiple cakes

**Party Boxes**:
- For 50 guests: 3–4 large party boxes + 2 celebration cakes
- For 100 guests: 6–8 large party boxes + 4 celebration cakes

## The Ordering Timeline

- **8 weeks before**: Book your caterer, confirm guest numbers
- **4 weeks before**: Place custom cake orders for complex designs
- **1 week before**: Confirm final numbers; order standard small chops platters
- **48 hours before**: Final confirmation with your baker

## Working With a Nigerian Bakery in the UK

When ordering from a Nigerian bakery like Sweet Delight, communicate:

1. The occasion and any cultural significance
2. Dietary requirements (halal, vegetarian, nut allergies)
3. Delivery address and time
4. Any personalisation (cake toppers, messages)

With the right planning, your guests will be talking about the food for years to come!

## What Is Chin Chin?

Chin chin (also written as "chin-chin") is a traditional West African fried snack made from a simple dough of flour, sugar, butter, eggs, and flavourings. The dough is rolled out and cut into small pieces — typically strips, twists, or small rounds — then deep-fried until golden and crunchy.

The taste is mildly sweet, the texture is satisfyingly crunchy, and the aroma while frying is intoxicating. It is absolutely addictive.

## Different Variations

### Classic Plain Chin Chin
The most common variety. Made with just flour, sugar, butter, egg, and a hint of nutmeg. Simple, perfect, timeless.

### Coconut Chin Chin
A beloved variation that adds desiccated coconut and coconut milk to the dough, giving it a slightly tropical sweetness.

### Spicy Chin Chin
For those who like a kick — scotch bonnet or cayenne pepper is added to the dough for a savoury heat.

### Flavoured Varieties
Modern makers experiment with vanilla, orange zest, sesame seeds, and even chocolate.

## Chin Chin in Nigerian Culture

Chin chin is deeply embedded in Nigerian culture as both a snack and a gift:

- **Christmas tradition**: Bags of chin chin are made at home (or bought) and given as gifts during the festive season
- **Party tables**: Bowls of chin chin sit on every Nigerian party table
- **Hampers**: Premium chin chin bags are included in Nigerian Christmas and Eid hampers
- **Everyday snacking**: Popular in schools, offices, and homes across Nigeria

## Chin Chin Goes Global

As the Nigerian diaspora spread across the world, chin chin followed. In the UK, chin chin has found a new audience — not just among Nigerians and West Africans, but among British food lovers who are discovering the joy of West African snacks.

It's appearing in African food markets, Caribbean shops, and increasingly in premium food hampers. Sweet Delight's chin chin is made using the traditional recipe, with the right balance of sweetness and crunch.

## How to Enjoy Chin Chin

- On its own as a snack (honestly, the best way)
- With a cold drink — Fanta, Tiger nut milk, or even beer!
- As part of a small chops platter at parties
- In hampers as a thoughtful gift

Order our chin chin bags for delivery anywhere in the UK.

## Your Complete Guide to Ordering a Custom Birthday Cake

A custom birthday cake is one of the most personal gifts you can give. Getting it right — the right size, flavour, design, and quality — requires a bit of planning. Here's everything you need to know.

## Step 1: Decide on the Size

Cake size is measured in inches across and typically corresponds to how many servings you need:

| Size | Tiers | Servings |
|------|-------|---------|
| 6" round | 1 | 12–16 portions |
| 8" round | 1 | 24–30 portions |
| 10" round | 1 | 38–50 portions |
| 6" + 8" tiered | 2 | 36–46 portions |
| 6" + 8" + 10" | 3 | 74–96 portions |

For a birthday party of 30 guests, an 8" round is typically perfect.

## Step 2: Choose Your Flavour

At Sweet Delight, we offer:

- **Sponge**: Classic vanilla, lemon, strawberry, or chocolate
- **Filling**: Italian meringue buttercream, ganache, fresh cream, or jam
- **Special flavours**: Nigerian chin chin cake, coconut cake, rum & raisin

## Step 3: Specify the Design

This is where the magic happens. When ordering, provide:

- **Reference photos**: Share 2–3 images that capture the style you want
- **Colours**: Specific hex codes or descriptions (e.g., "dusty rose and gold")
- **Decorations**: Fondant, buttercream texture, fresh flowers, edible images, or toppers
- **Message**: The exact wording to be written on the cake
- **Theme**: Princess, football, botanical, luxury minimal, Nigerian patterns, etc.

## Step 4: Plan Your Timeline

Custom cakes require time and care:

- **Standard cakes** (single tier, simple design): 5 days minimum notice
- **Tiered cakes**: 7–10 days minimum
- **Complex fondant work**: 2 weeks recommended
- **Very large orders**: Contact us 4 weeks in advance for weddings and large events
